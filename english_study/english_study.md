The run of the golden bull

Their spirits were sunken and low
Their bags weighted more than a ton
There was neither sign nor show
When the Bull began his run
The shills were shilling wall-to-wall
The gig was up;they'd had their fun
And every short got a margin call
When the Bull began his run
The candles green came fast and tall
Each wick was bold,quick to stun
His eyes burned red,and his horns did maul
When the Bull began his run
Now Fortune smiles upon the neat
His bags of gold gleam in the sun
Doubters dream of his balance sheet
And every bear is left with none
Since the Bull began his run
